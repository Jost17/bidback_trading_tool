-- SQL DATA RECOVERY SCRIPT
-- =====================================
-- Fixes corrupted CSV import records affected by:
-- 1. Comma formatting in S&P 500 values ("6,005.88" â†’ "6005.88")  
-- 2. Missing T2108 values (data quality improvement)
-- 3. Field validation and cleanup
-- 
-- Usage: sqlite3 market_monitor.db < sql-data-recovery.sql

-- Enable WAL mode for safer operations
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;

-- Create recovery log table
