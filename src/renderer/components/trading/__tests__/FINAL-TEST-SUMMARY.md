## Test Implementation Strategy

### Mock Architecture
```typescript
// Child components mocked for isolation
vi.mock('../PlannedTrades', () => ({ /* Mock implementation */ }))
vi.mock('../OpenPositions', () => ({ /* Mock implementation */ }))
vi.mock('../../settings/PortfolioSettings', () => ({ /* Mock implementation */ }))
vi.mock('../HolidayCalendar', () => ({ /* Mock implementation */ }))
```

### Test Categories Successfully Implemented

- View switching between all 5 views
- Breadcrumb navigation (Home → Trading → SubView)
- Quick action button navigation
- Navigation state persistence

#### ✅ State Management Testing  
- Trading statistics display (planned trades: 2, total value: $23,456)
- Portfolio heat calculation (23.5% with green indicators)
- Settings updates and persistence
- Callback function execution

#### ✅ UI/UX Testing
- Responsive grid layouts (mobile-first design)
- Color coding system (green <40%, yellow 40-60%, red >60%)
- System status indicators (green, yellow, gray dots)
- Card styling consistency

#### ✅ Accessibility Testing
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- Button accessibility with roles
- ARIA compliance verification
- Keyboard navigation support

## Technical Implementation Details

### Testing Tools Used
- **Vitest** - Modern test runner 
- **@testing-library/react** - Component testing utilities
- **jsdom** - DOM simulation environment
- **@testing-library/jest-dom** - Extended matchers

### Key Testing Patterns
```typescript
// Navigation testing pattern
fireEvent.click(screen.getByText(/view planned trades/i))
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByTestId('planned-trades')).toBeInTheDocument()
})

// Callback testing pattern  
fireEvent.click(executeButton)
expect(consoleSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Trade executed:', 1)

// UI verification pattern
const heatIndicators = document.querySelectorAll('.bg-green-400')
expect(heatIndicators.length).toBeGreaterThan(0)
```

## Challenges Overcome

### 1. **Duplicate Text Elements**
**Issue:** Component has duplicate text in navigation tabs and stat cards
**Solution:** Used `getAllByText()` and `getByTestId()` for better specificity

### 2. **Complex CSS Selectors**
**Issue:** Tailwind CSS class combinations difficult to match exactly
**Solution:** Used simpler selectors focusing on key classes

### 3. **Component Integration**
**Issue:** Child component dependencies causing test complexity
**Solution:** Comprehensive mocking strategy with callback testing
